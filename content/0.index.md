# Welcome to Nimiq Tutorial!

This is an interactive tutorial to help you get started with the Nimiq Web Client and its concepts.

The goal of this tutorial is to give you a quick experience of what it feels like to work with Nimiq, **right in the browser**. That's one of Nimiq's core values: Anyone can be a node without installing anything.


Start editing the code on the right and see the changes live on the left. Have fun with it!
