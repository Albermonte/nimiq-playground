# How Nimiq Playground works?

The Nimiq Web client creates a node and connects to the Nimiq network. It can be used to send transactions, create accounts, and more. The Nimiq Web client is a full node, meaning it downloads the entire blockchain and validates all transactions. This is a secure way to interact with the Nimiq network, but it requires a lot of resources.

Something similar happens with the Nimiq Playground. The Nimiq Playground is a full node that runs in your browser. Start playing
